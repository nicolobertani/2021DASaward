# 2021DASaward

This repository hosts the presentation I have prepared for the 2021 DAS Student Paper Award - INFORMS, received for the paper **.
This is joint work with Abdellah Boukhatem, [Enrico Diecidue](), Patrice Perny and Paolo Viappiani.

The presentation is interactive and leverages rmarkdown and shiny apps.
Therefore it must be run from within Rstudio.

The manuscript is [available on SSRN]().
