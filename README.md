# 2021DASaward

This repository hosts the presentation I prepared for the 2021 DAS Award Session - INFORMS, where I received the Best Student Paper Award for the paper *Fast and Simple Adaptive Elicitations: Experimental Test for Probability Weighting*.
This is joint work with Abdellah Boukhatem, [Enrico Diecidue](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/enrico-diecidue), Patrice Perny and Paolo Viappiani.
The latest version of this paper is [available on SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3569625).

The presentation is interactive, it is written in Rmarkdown and uses shiny apps.
It must thus be run from within Rstudio.
